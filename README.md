# Garden

*General public*: This is not a real application designed for real world use. It is an application I was asked to do as part of a technical interview for a position somewhere. The rest of this readme is written in a conversational style, and would not normally be how I'd write an README.md. An example of how I would normally approach a readme can be found [here][0] and [here][1].

*Interviewers*: Hello, I'm Jamie and look forward to discussing my work with you. Normally I'd run my readmes through an LLM to make them less wordy and less me, but in this case I've left them as is. Forgive any typos.

## Aims

This repository has two aims. The first is to provide an insight into how I write code, the way that I approach the writing of code and my general ability to solve a problem. Obviously, this is important.

The second aim is to build an application that allows people to create garden layouts and to which plans can be saved. The Application will give a score on plans based on various

## Experience

The command line is how the user will interface with the API (_or maybe postman if that's how you roll_).

There should be three distinct stages from starting to getting a plan.

1. Create the layout with the beds and data about the beds. 
2. Create the plan with strategy for each bed. 
3. Query for a score for their plan.


## Installation

### Requirements

This application was built using the below versions. It would likley work on other versions and if this was anything other than a demo, I'd give a list of full compatibility and ensure they were added into the CI tests.

* Elixir - 1.18.3
* Erlang - 27.3.4
* Postgres - 17~
