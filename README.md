# Garden

*General public*: This is not a real application designed for real world use. It is an application I was asked to do as part of a technical interview for a position somewhere. The rest of this readme is written in a conversational style, and would not normally be how I'd write an README.md. An example of how I would normally approach a readme can be found [here][0] and [here][1].

*Interviewers*: Hello, I'm Jamie and look forward to discussing my work with you. Normally I'd run my readmes through an LLM to make them less wordy and less me, but in this case I've left them as is. Forgive any typos.

## Installation

### Requirements

This application was built using the below versions. It would likley work on other versions and if this was anything other than a demo, I'd give a list of full compatibility and ensure they were added into the CI tests.

* Elixir - 1.18.3
* Erlang - 27.3.4
* Postgres - 17~
